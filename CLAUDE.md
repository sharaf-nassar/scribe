# llm-router

## Task tracking

Beads (`bd`). Context loads via the SessionStart hook in
`.claude/settings.json` — run `bd prime` if it is missing or stale.

## lat.md

- Before coding: `lat search "<task>"` to find the relevant design intent.
- After changing behavior, architecture, or tests: update `lat.md/`, then
  run `lat check`.
- Syntax and section rules live in the `lat-md` skill, not here.

## Build & Test

No build step — pi loads `llm-router.ts` directly (registered in
`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`). Smoke test (fixtures + one live verdict):

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types smoke.ts ["task text"]
```

## Architecture Overview

Single-file pi extension (`llm-router.ts`): a judge LLM routes each
session's first prompt to one of 7 model arms via CPA/CLIProxyAPI, with
post-verdict quota swaps and an interactive `/llm-router-config` menu.
`exemplars.jsonl` provides measured-outcome few-shot for the judge.
See README.md for the full design.

## Conventions & Patterns

- User-facing config lives in `~/.pi/agent/llm-router.json`, re-read per
  routed prompt — never require a pi restart for a config change.
- Pure logic (swap resolution, quota aggregation) stays in exported
  functions with fixtures in `smoke.ts`; probe failures degrade to
  ungated routing with a visible notice, never a blocked session.
